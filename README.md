# Storing_reading_data_GetMethod

This project is created to work with data sent from sensors. the data that will be sent are temperature and humidity. Using the get method it will get the data sent and save it in the database then the user can open and see what is the last data sent from the sensors.

There are two php files:
- store_data.php --> uses the $_GET method to take the data from the sensors and store them in the database.
- print_data.php --> is used to read and print out the last data that has been stored.

Also, one HTML file that is connected with the print_data.php file it just gives the user a link which they can click and and see the data.


there is an image file which has the screenShots of all the outputs of this project.
